                    <h3>UX/CX &amp; Marketing</h3>
                    <p>I assist UX/CX designers, practitioners and Marketing professionals with workshops, persona profiling and user flows. I have also supported those professionals by translating their research into wireframes, prototypes, concepts and designs.</p>
                    <h3>Technical</h3>
                    <p>I can markup HTML/SCSS. I write HTML to meet W3C validations and can create HTML prototypes and templates. I am interested in accessibility best practices which I apply where I can (adhering to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Link to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview" target="_blank">WCAG</a>). I am also familiar with task runners and JavaScript/jQuery. I work closely with integration teams across diversified technologies.</p>
