<div class="description">

A portfolio Progressive Web Application designed and built for a portrait artist. Displaying the artwork at its best, fitting the browser window where possible was a client request. Along with being able to zoom in on images.

The client also requested a straight forward, easy to use Content Management System as the technical skills of the client are proudly not the best.
