This is a portfolio website designed and built for Lynn Pronk, a portrait artist. Displaying the artwork at its best, fitting the browser window where possible was a  client request. Along with being able to zoom in on images.

The client requested a straight forward, easy to use Content Management System (CMS) as the technical skills of the client are proudly not the best.
