<div class="description">

Auckland Airport Concierge Service is a module add-on incorporated into their existing website styles.

I created wireframes, user flows and hi definition mocks for stakeholders.

I have also worked on the front end, building HTML/LESS templates and defining responsive layouts for the Auckland Airports site redesign. Templates were shared with stakeholders for review & evaluation and delivered to the Sitecore integration team.
