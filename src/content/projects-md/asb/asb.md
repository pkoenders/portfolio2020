<div class="description">

ASB bank Single Sign On for their banking products. ASBâ€™s vision was to have a consistent UI login experience across their products. A consistent look with minimal disruption to their users and Call Centre.

I created wireframes, user flows and hi definition mocks for stakeholders. HTML prototypes were also created for their integration team.
