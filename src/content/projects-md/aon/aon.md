<div class="description">

AON Insurance bringing their products online. Their first project was to create a web presence for their Landlord Insurance.

I designed and wireframes, user flows, hi definition mocks and HTML prototypes for their stakeholders. I was also asked to create the templates for the integration team.

The client asked that accessibility be a focus. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for AA colour contrast standards and accessible keyboard navigation.
